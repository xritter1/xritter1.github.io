# Final Project: Trivia

## Proposal
- See proposal [PDF](https://github.com/xritter1/ga_fewd/blob/main/final_project/GA_FEWD_final_project.pdf) for wireframe.

## Game Logic
- 5 question cards that can be flipped
- True/False questions
- Bring in 5 questions from Trivia API (tbd which one as there are a few)
- Each question brings 1 point if correctly answered
- You can choose which question to answer first but there will be a visual guide as in numbers on the question cards
- If correctly answered, a sign will show up (x/checkmark)
- After all questions are answered, show the final score


## Design
- See [PDF](https://github.com/xritter1/ga_fewd/blob/main/final_project/GA_FEWD_final_project.pdf) for wireframe.


### Alternatives
- If signs do not show up after answering, show points lost/won instead
- If API calls will fail, hardcode questions.
